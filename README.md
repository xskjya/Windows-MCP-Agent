**Windows MCP** is a lightweight, open-source project that enables seamless integration between AI agents and the Windows operating system. Acting as an MCP server bridges the gap between LLMs and the Windows operating system, allowing agents to perform tasks such as **file navigation, application control, UI interaction, QA testing,** and more.

## Updates

- Try out ü™ü[Windows-Use](https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-Use)!!, an agent built using Windows-MCP.
- Windows-MCP is now featured as Desktop Extension in `Claude Desktop`.

### Supported Operating Systems

- Windows 7
- Windows 8, 8.1
- Windows 10
- Windows 11  

## üé• Demos

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b372dc-8d00-4d71-9677-4c64f5987485>

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Seamless Windows Integration**  
  Interacts natively with Windows UI elements, opens apps, controls windows, simulates user input, and more.

- **Use Any LLM (Vision Optional)**
   Unlike many automation tools, Windows MCP doesn't rely on any traditional computer vision techniques or specific fine-tuned models; it works with any LLMs, reducing complexity and setup time.

- **Rich Toolset for UI Automation**  
  Includes tools for basic keyboard, mouse operation and capturing window/UI state.

- **Lightweight & Open-Source**  
  Minimal dependencies and easy setup with full source code available under MIT license.

- **Customizable & Extendable**  
  Easily adapt or extend tools to suit your unique automation or AI integration needs.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., from one mouse click to the next) ranges from **0.7 to 2.5 secs**, and may slightly vary based on the number of active applications and system load, also the inferencing speed of the llm.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Anthropic Claude Desktop app or other MCP Clients
- UV (Package Manager) from Astra, install with `pip install uv`
- DXT (Desktop Extension) from Antropic, install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/dxt`
- `English` as the default language in Windows or disable the `Launch-Tool` and `Resize-Tool` in the MCP Server for Windows with other languages.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Gemini CLI

1. Navigate to `%USERPROFILE%/.gemini` in File Explorer and open `settings.json`.

2. Add the `windows-mcp` config in the `settings.json` and save it.

```json
{
  "theme": "Default",
  ...
//MCP Server Config
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path to the windows-mcp directory>",
        "run",
        "main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Rerun Gemini CLI in terminal. Enjoy ü•≥

### Claude Desktop

1. Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP.git
cd Windows-MCP
```

2. Build Desktop Extension `DXT`:

```shell
npx @anthropic-ai/dxt pack
```

3. Open Claude Desktop:

Go to Claude Desktop: Settings->Extensions->Install Extension (locate the `.dxt` file)-> Install

Finally Enjoy ü•≥.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èCaution

This MCP interacts directly with your Windows operating system to perform actions. Use with caution and avoid deploying it in environments where such risks cannot be tolerated.

## üìù Limitations

- Selecting specific sections of the text in a paragraph, as the MCP is relying on a11y tree. (‚åõ Working on it.)
- `Type-Tool` is meant for typing text, not programming in IDE because of it types program as a whole in a file. (‚åõ Working on it.)
